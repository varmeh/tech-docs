| 409 Conflict | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.                  | Indicates that the request could not be processed because of a conflict.     | During processing, when a conflict in resource state is detected. |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions. | The client's request was well-formed, but semantically incorrect.             | Validation Errors |
| 500 Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.                    | A generic error message when a server exception prevents the request.        | Error during Request Processing |
