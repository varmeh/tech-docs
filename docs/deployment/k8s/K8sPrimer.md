## What is Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes, or `K8s`, is an open-source orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- It manages clusters of servers and runs containers across them, balancing the load.

## [Key Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/)

### 1. Cluster

- A set of machines called nodes that run containerized applications.
- Contains both control plane nodes (master) and worker nodes.

### 2. Node

- A physical or virtual machine that runs the containers.
- Managed by the control plane.

### 3. Pod

- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Contains one or more containers.

### 4. Service

- Exposes pods to the network, either internally within the cluster or externally.
- Handles load balancing across multiple pods.

### 5. Deployment

- Defines the desired state of an application.
- Manages the scaling and updating of pods.

### 6. ConfigMap & Secret

- `ConfigMap`: Manages configuration data as key-value pairs.
- `Secret`: Manages sensitive information, like passwords.

### 7. Volume

- Provides storage to containers within a pod.
- Can be persistent across pod restarts.

### 8. Namespace

- Logical separation within a cluster.
- Allows for organization and isolation of resources.

### 9. ReplicaSet

- Ensures the specified number of replicas for a pod are running.
- Managed by deployments.

### 10. StatefulSet

- Manages stateful applications, maintaining unique identities and states across pods.

### 11. DaemonSet

- Ensures a copy of a pod runs on specific or all nodes in the cluster.

### 12. Ingress

- Manages external access to services within the cluster.
- Provides routing and load balancing.

### 13. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

- Automatically scales the number of pods based on observed metrics like CPU usage.

## [Key Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/)

### 1. Control Plane Components

- **kube-apiserver:** Exposes the Kubernetes API.
- **etcd:** Consistent and highly-available key-value store for all cluster data.
- **kube-scheduler:** Schedules pods to run on nodes.
- **kube-controller-manager:** Runs controllers for nodes, replicas, endpoints, etc.
- **cloud-controller-manager:** Runs controllers specific to the underlying cloud provider.

### 2. Node Components

- **kubelet:** Ensures that containers are running in a pod.
- **kube-proxy:** Manages network rules and enables communication to and from your pods.
- **Container Runtime:** Software for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

## Ksy Concepts vs Components

- The `key concepts` are the fundamental building blocks you work with when defining and interacting with your applications in Kubernetes
- The `key components` are the underlying mechanisms that make Kubernetes work as a system
- Both are crucial to understanding how to effectively work with Kubernetes

## K8s using Docker Desktop

### What is it?

- Docker Desktop for Mac includes a standalone Kubernetes server that runs on your Mac.

### Enabling Kubernetes

- **Access Preferences:** Go to the Preferences/Settings menu in Docker Desktop.
- **Enable Kubernetes:** There's an option to enable Kubernetes, which will install the Kubernetes components necessary to run a single-node cluster locally.
- **Configure (Optional):** You can customize the Kubernetes version and other settings if needed.
- **Apply & Restart:** Click the "Apply & Restart" button, and Docker Desktop will set up a local Kubernetes cluster for you.

### How It Works Under the Hood

- **Kubernetes Inside Docker:** Docker Desktop runs the Kubernetes control plane and worker components inside Docker containers.
- **Shared Resources:** It shares system resources with Docker, so you don't need a separate VM for Kubernetes.
- **Integration with Docker CLI:** It integrates with your Docker CLI, allowing you to use `kubectl` commands just as you would with a remote cluster.
- **Local Registry:** Supports a local registry, allowing for easier image sharing and testing.
- **Networking:** It sets up networking so that you can communicate with your cluster using `localhost`.

### Mac HyperKit Hypervisor

- **Hypervisor.framework:**
  - Docker Desktop uses macOS's Hypervisor.framework (*through HyperKit*) to run a lightweight Linux VM
  - This is where your Docker containers (and Kubernetes) are actually running
  - It is a lightweight, native macOS hypervisor based on xhyve. It's bundled with Docker Desktop

- **Port Forwarding:** Docker Desktop handles port forwarding from the VM to your macOS system. When a service in a container inside the VM listens on a port, Docker Desktop forwards traffic from that port on `localhost` to the corresponding port on the VM.
- **Kubernetes Services:** When you expose a Kubernetes service on a particular port, it's accessible at that port on `localhost` in your Macâ€™s browser or other networking tools.

## K8s Commands
