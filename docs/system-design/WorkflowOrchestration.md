## 1. Traditional Workflow Orchestration Methods

Before modern workflow orchestration platforms like **Temporal, Camunda, or Airflow**, developers built custom solutions using **databases, message queues, cron jobs, and manual state management**. Below are the common approaches used.

### 1.1 Database-Driven Workflows

#### How it Worked

- Each step of the workflow was stored in a **database table** (e.g., `workflows` table).
- A **background polling job (cron job or worker)** periodically checked for workflows in a "pending" state.
- When an external event happened (e.g., **KYC completion**), an **update query** was triggered to mark the next step as active.
- The **background job picked up the next step** and executed it.

#### Challenges

‚ùå **Inefficient Polling**: The system had to keep checking the database for pending workflows.  
‚ùå **Scaling Issues**: Too many workflows led to high database load.  
‚ùå **Failure Handling**: If a job failed, someone had to manually restart or write custom retry logic.  
‚ùå **Complex State Management**: Manual tracking of workflow progress.

#### Example SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflows (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL,
    step VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

A **cron job** checked for pending workflows and processed them.

### 1.2 Message Queue-Based Workflows

#### How it Worked

- Instead of polling a database, a **message queue** (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, SQS, Kafka) was used.
- When a step was completed, an event (message) was **pushed to a queue**.
- Background workers **listened to the queue** and executed the next step.
- Failed tasks were **pushed to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for retries.

#### Challenges

‚ùå **No Global State Management**: Hard to track workflow progress.  
‚ùå **Duplicate Processing**: Extra safeguards were needed to prevent reprocessing.  
‚ùå **Hard to Debug & Monitor**: No centralized view of workflow progress.

#### Example Process Flow

1. **Customer onboarded** ‚Üí Message sent to `kyc_pending_queue`
2. **KYC Completed** ‚Üí Message sent to `card_issuance_queue`
3. **Card Issued** ‚Üí Message sent to `card_limit_queue`

#### Example RabbitMQ Publishing

```python
channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key='kyc_pending_queue',
                      body=json.dumps(customer_data))
```

### 1.3 Cron Job-Based Processing

#### How it Worked

- **Cron jobs** ran at **fixed intervals** to check for incomplete workflows.
- They called **APIs** or processed **database entries** to move workflows forward.

#### Challenges

‚ùå **Not real-time**: Jobs ran on a fixed schedule, causing delays.  
‚ùå **Hard to scale**: Too many workflows caused delays in execution.  
‚ùå **Manual Retries**: Developers had to write custom retry logic.

#### Example Cron Job Setup

```bash
*/5 * * * * python process_workflows.py
```

#### Example Python Script for Pending Workflows

```python
def process_pending_workflows():
    workflows = db.fetch("SELECT * FROM workflows WHERE status='pending'")
    for wf in workflows:
        process_workflow(wf)
```

---

### 1.4 Hybrid Approach (DB + Queues + Workers)

#### How it Worked

- Used a **database** for tracking workflow state.
- Used a **message queue** to push tasks **only when needed**.
- Workers processed tasks asynchronously.

#### Example Process

1. **Partner API** stores onboarding request in DB.
2. **KYC is incomplete** ‚Üí Background worker waits for an event.
3. **Once KYC is complete** ‚Üí Workflow updates DB and triggers a message queue.
4. **Card issuance service listens for messages** and issues a card.
5. **Final worker assigns card limits** and marks the process complete.

#### Challenges

‚ùå **Still manual retries** ‚Äì needed custom logic.  
‚ùå **Multiple moving parts** ‚Äì hard to debug failures.

## 2. Modern Workflow Orchestration with Temporal

### 2.1 How Temporal Works

Temporal provides a **stateful, durable, and fault-tolerant** way to manage workflows. It ensures that **each step is tracked, retried, and resumed from failures**.

#### Key Components

- **Workflows**: Define the sequence of steps.
- **Activities**: External calls (e.g., APIs, database operations).

#### Steps in Card Issuance Workflow

1. **Partner Onboards Customer** ‚Üí Starts a workflow.
2. **Wait for KYC Completion** (indefinite wait).
3. **Trigger Card Issuance** (handles failures with retries).
4. **Set Card Limit** (final step, failure handling).

#### Temporal Workflow Implementation (Python)

```python
import temporalio.workflow
from activities import start_kyc, issue_card, set_card_limit

@temporalio.workflow.defn
class CardIssuanceWorkflow:
    @temporalio.workflow.run
    async def run(self, customer_id: str):
        await temporalio.workflow.execute_activity(start_kyc, customer_id)
        await temporalio.workflow.wait_signal("kyc_completed")
        card_id = await temporalio.workflow.execute_activity(issue_card, customer_id)
        await temporalio.workflow.execute_activity(set_card_limit, card_id)
        return f"Card issued for customer {customer_id}"
```

### 2.2 Temporal Alternatives

| Workflow Engine  | Pros | Cons |
|-----------------|------|------|
| **Cadence (Uber)** | Scalable, mature | Harder to set up than Temporal |
| **Apache Airflow** | Good for batch workflows | Not event-driven, polling-based |
| **Camunda Zeebe** | BPMN-based visual workflows | Complex setup |
| **AWS Step Functions** | Serverless, managed by AWS | Tied to AWS |
| **Netflix Conductor** | Built for microservices | Complex setup |

---

### 2.3 Why Temporal is the Best Choice

‚úÖ **Stateful, Event-Driven** ‚Üí Waits indefinitely for KYC without polling.  
‚úÖ **Automatic Retries** ‚Üí Handles API failures without manual retries.  
‚úÖ **Fault-Tolerant** ‚Üí Resumes from the last successful step.  
‚úÖ **Scalability** ‚Üí Handles **millions of workflows efficiently**.  
‚úÖ **Observability** ‚Üí UI to track where workflows are stuck.

## 3. Conclusion

Older workflow methods relied on **databases, queues, and cron jobs**, leading to **scalability and reliability issues**. **Modern workflow orchestration tools like Temporal** solve these challenges by handling **state, retries, and failures automatically**. üöÄ
